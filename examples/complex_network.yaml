# Complex HydroSim Network Configuration Example
#
# This example demonstrates a more complex water network with:
# - Multiple storage nodes with active drawdown
# - Source nodes with different generation strategies
# - Multiple demand types (municipal and agricultural)
# - Links with controls and hydraulic models
#
# Storage nodes demonstrate:
# - Independent drawdown and refill operations
# - Capacity constraints (max_storage and min_storage)
# - Automatic prioritization: demands > storage > spilling
