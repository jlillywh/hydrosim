# Simple HydroSim Network Configuration Example
#
# This example demonstrates a basic water network with:
# - A reservoir (storage node) with active drawdown capability
# - A municipal demand
# - Time series climate data
#
# The storage node will automatically:
# - Draw down to meet demand when inflow is insufficient
# - Refill when inflow exceeds demand
# - Respect capacity constraints (max_storage and min_storage)
